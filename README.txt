Various Unicon projects for public access

This code you find in this repository may be of interest to many or may be of interest to none. It is here available to all for any purpose for which you find it useful.

The code available will be in various states, most will be work in progress. As time permits, the code comments will be brought up to the Unicon IPL standard. At this point, much of the code is uncommented.

I guarantee nothing about the code, not even that it is working. I provide simply so that if you wish to use it as an example or as a base for anything you want to do, you can so do so.
