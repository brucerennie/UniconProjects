be used to give specific information about the procedure and record definitions
that are in each of the Unicon IPL procs directory.

from the header comments in the specific files, as well as any other applicable
comments in the file.

For each file, there is a definition description of the fields for any records
defined, including any type information that is available. As well as this

For each file, there is s definition description of the procedures defined. This
includes for each parameter, any type information as well as the return types
(including failure indicators) and any runtime error conditions that can arise.
